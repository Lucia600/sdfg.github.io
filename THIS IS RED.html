        <u>Teachers assume that by the end of</u> primary <br><br><br><br> school, students should know the essentials regarding shape. For example,the NSW Mathematics K–6 syllabus states by year six students should be able manipulate, classify and draw twodimensional shapes and describe<a href="http//:www.google.com" taget="blank">side and angle properties. The reality is, that due to the pressure for students to achieve mastery in number, teachers often spend less time teaching about the</a>other aspects of mathematics, especially shape (Becker, 2003; Horne, 2003). Hence, there is a need to modify <b><agent>the focus of mathematics educationto incorporate other aspects of mathematics including shape and especially polygons. The purpose of this article is to look at the teaching and learning of</agent></b>polygons in primary classrooms by providing some essential information about polygons and some useful teaching strategies and resources

        In geometry, a shape can be defined as the form of an object or its outline, outer boundary or outer surface. Everything we see in the world around us has a shape. We can find different basic shapes such as the two-dimensional such as square, rectangle, and oval or the three-dimensional rectangular such as prism, cylinder, and sphere in the objects we see around us. These geometric shapes appear in objects we see as credit cards, bills and coins, finger rings, photo frames, dart boards, huts, windows, magician’s wands, tall buildings, flower pots, toy trains, and balloons.
